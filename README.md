# Chatwall

A chatting app based on MEAN stack with features of:

1. Search for friends, view their profile in 'Search' tab
2. Send friend requests in 'Search' tab
3. Accept/Reject friend request in 'Inbox' tab
4. View notification message in 'Inbox' tab
5. Chat with friends (individually) in 'Friends' tab
6. All notification messages in 'Inbox' tab and all chat messages between friends in 'Friends' tab will persist (stored in MongoDB)

Check it out at https://mean-chatwall.herokuapp.com  

This app takes the idea of being able to search for friends and send friends requests from Facebook,  
combined with an old school style MSN chatbox

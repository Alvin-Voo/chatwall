# Chatwall

A chatting app based on MEAN stack with features of:

1. Search for friends, view their profile in 'Search' tab
2. Send friend requests in 'Search' tab
3. Accept/Reject friend request in 'Inbox' tab
4. View notification message in 'Inbox' tab
5. Blinking notification in notification area for new messages in 'Inbox' tab
6. All notification messages in 'Inbox' tab are persisted (stored in MongoDB)
7. Friends online and offline status reflected in real time on friends (mat)card in 'Friends tab'
8. Chat with friends (individually) in 'Friends' tab
9. Blinking friends (mat)card for new chat messages received in 'Friends' tab
10. All chat messages between friends in 'Friends' tab are persisted (stored in MongoDB)

Check it out at https://mean-chatwall.herokuapp.com. Be mindful that it is a bit laggy here since I'm using free tier.  

This app takes the idea of being able to search for friends and send friends requests from Facebook,  
combined with an old school style MSN chatbox
